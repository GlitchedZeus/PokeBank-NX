## Confirmed findings — repository metadata / CI

### AUDIT-001 — destructive mutable PKSE import workflow
- Severity: P1
- Confidence: CONFIRMED
- Area: CI / repository integrity
- File: `.github/workflows/import-pkse.yml`
- Evidence: `contents: write`; trigger on a push to `main` changing this workflow; fetches unpinned `pkse/master`; runs `git checkout "$upstream_sha" -- .`; commits and pushes to `main`. The workflow calls this “PKSE 1.1.3” without pinning a 1.1.3 tag/SHA.
- Why it matters: editing this workflow can replace the PokeBank NX default-branch tree with whatever PKSE master contains at run time.
- Recommended fix: retire it after the historical import, or make it manual/read-only and pin an immutable upstream revision. Never overlay upstream onto `.` and push directly to `main`.
- Owner: dedicated cleanup / MAIN.

### AUDIT-002 — no general unfiltered native PR compile gate
- Severity: P2
- Confidence: HIGH
- Area: CI / Switch-native coverage
- Files: `.github/workflows/**`
- Evidence: `host-tests.yml` is unfiltered across PRs but host-only. devkitA64 jobs are branch/path scoped or historical/manual; shared native-sensitive files outside those path filters can change without a Switch compile/link job.
- Why it matters: a host-green PR can still break libnx/device-only compilation or packaging.
- Recommended fix: add one broad PR native compile/link gate; keep specialized filtered jobs as supplemental checks.
- Owner: MAIN / CI.

### AUDIT-003 — mutable native toolchain image
- Severity: P3
- Confidence: CONFIRMED
- Area: CI reproducibility
- Files: multiple native workflows
- Evidence: builds use `devkitpro/devkita64:latest` rather than an immutable digest.
- Why it matters: identical source SHAs can build differently after the image advances.
- Recommended fix: pin a tested digest/version for candidate/release builds and update deliberately.
- Owner: MAIN / CI.

### AUDIT-004 — stale theme choices in physical bug template
- Severity: P4
- Confidence: CONFIRMED
- Area: docs/templates
- File: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/device_bug_report.md`
- Evidence: it only lists `OLED Black / Dark / Light` even though current builds support additional themes.
- Recommended fix: make the field free-form or list the current set.
- Owner: docs-only / UI-QoL.

### AUDIT-005 — historical branch-specific workflows remain tracked
- Severity: P4
- Confidence: CONFIRMED
- Area: CI maintainability
- Files: old Gen I/II/III candidate/retest/recovery workflows
- Evidence: several jobs are permanently tied to `feature/pokebank-playable` or frozen historical SHAs while live work now flows through PR #79 → #90 with #92/#97 overlays.
- Recommended fix: preserve historical evidence in docs/releases, then retire or clearly mark historical/manual workflows.
- Owner: dedicated cleanup.
