     * Text and number prompts.
     *
     * PKSE draws its own keyboard: UIManager registers a KeyboardPresenter, which shows a themed
     * keyboard over the screen that raised the prompt and keeps that screen drawing underneath it,
     * so a search can filter its list while the query is still being typed. The console's own
     * keyboard (swkbd) is kept as promptSystemText() -- what the on-screen one hands off to for
     * scripts it has no keys for -- and as the fallback when no presenter is registered.
     *
     * Either way the call BLOCKS until the prompt is answered. Three rules follow, and all are
     * load-bearing:
     *
     *  - **Call it only from a screen's update(), never from draw().** The UI loop runs
     *    update() -> draw() -> flush(), so at update() time no NanoVG frame is open. The presenter
     *    draws whole frames of its own, and swkbd suspends the app; either one started mid-draw
     *    would leave a half-built frame open underneath it.
     *  - **Never launch swkbd twice in one frame.** Launching a second system keyboard immediately
     *    after the first returns (both inside one update()) crashes on hardware: a library applet
     *    can't be torn down and relaunched back-to-back. The on-screen keyboard is not an applet and
     *    has no such limit, but promptSystemText() still is one.
     *  - **Treat a cancel as "no change", not as an empty string.** Returning "" for a cancel would
     *    blank whatever the user was editing, which is the opposite of what they asked for.
