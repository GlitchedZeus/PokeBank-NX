/**
 * PKSE's own keyboard: every text and number prompt, drawn in the app's theme instead of handing the
 * screen to the console's keyboard applet.
 *
 * The console's keyboard owns the whole display while it is up, so nothing PKSE draws can react to
 * what is being typed. This one is a card over the bottom of the screen and the screen above it keeps
 * drawing -- which is what lets a search filter its list while the query is still being typed.
 *
 * UIManager runs it (see UI.cpp): Utils::promptText hands it a request, and it pumps frames of its
 * own -- the screen that asked, then this card -- until the prompt is answered. State lives in
 * KeyboardState; this file owns the layout, the input and the drawing.
